## Getting Source Code for PAs

### Getting Source Code

Go back to the home directory by
```
cd ~
```
Usually, all works unrelated to system should be performed under the home directory.
Other directories under the root of file system (`/`) are related to system.
Therefore, do NOT finish your PAs and Labs under these directories by `sudo`.

<!-- > #### danger::不要使用root账户做实验!!!

> 更严重的, 你的误操作可能会无意中损坏系统文件, 导致系统无法启动!
> 往届有若干学长因此而影响了实验进度, 甚至由于损坏了实验相关的文件而影响了分数.
> 请大家引以为鉴, 不要贪图方便, 否则后果自负!

```

```
A directory called `ics2024` will be created.
This is the project directory for PAs.
Details will be explained in PA1.

Then issue the following commands to perform `git` configuration:
```
git config --global user.name "221220000-Zhang San" # your student ID and name
git config --global user.email "zhangsan@foo.com"   # your email
git config --global core.editor vim                 # your favorite editor
git config --global color.ui true
```
You should configure `git` with your student ID, name, and email.
Before continuing, please read [this](git.md) `git` tutorial to learn some basics of `git`.
Another material recommended by jyy is [Visualizing Git Concepts with D3][visual git].
You can learn some `git` commands with the help of visualization.

[visual git]: http://onlywei.github.io/explain-git-with-d3

Enter the project directory `ics2024`, then run
```
git branch -m master
bash init.sh nemu
bash init.sh abstract-machine
```
to initialize some subprojects.
The script will pull some subprojects from github.
We will explain them later.

Besides, the script will also add some environment variables into the bash configuration file `~/.bashrc`.
These variables are defined by absolute path to support the compilation of the subprojects.
Therefore, <font color=red>DO NOT move your project to another directory once finishing the initialization</font>,
else these variables will become invalid.
Particularly, if you use shell other than `bash`,
please set these variables in the corresponding configuration file manually.

To let the environment variables take effect, run
```
source ~/.bashrc
```
Then try
```
echo $NEMU_HOME
echo $AM_HOME
cd $NEMU_HOME
cd $AM_HOME
```
to check whether these environment variables get the right paths.
If both the `echo` commands report the right paths,
and both the `cd` command change to the target paths without errors, we are done.
If not, please double check the steps above and the shell you are using.

### Git usage

We will use the `branch` feature of `git` to manage the process of development.
A branch is an ordered list of commits, where a commit refers to some modifications in the project.

You can list all branches by
```
git branch
```
You will see there is only one branch called "master" now.
```
* master
```
To create a new branch, use `git checkout` command:
```
git checkout -b pa0
```
This command will create a branch called `pa0`, and check out to it.
Now list all branches again, and you will see we are now at branch `pa0`:
```
  master
* pa0
```
From now on, all modifications of files in the project will be recorded in the branch `pa0`.

Now have a try!
Modify the `STUID` and `STUNAME` variables in `ics2024/Makefile`:
```
STUID = 221220000  # your student ID
STUNAME = 张三     # your Chinese name
```
Run
```
git status
```
to see those files modified from the last commit:
```
On branch pa0
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   Makefile

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
Run
```
git diff
```
to list modifications from the last commit:
```diff
diff --git a/Makefile b/Makefile
index c9b1708..b7b2e02 100644
--- a/Makefile
+++ b/Makefile
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
-STUID = 221220000
-STUNAME = 张三
+STUID = 221221234
+STUNAME = 李四

  # DO NOT modify the following code!!!
```
You should see `STUID` and `STUNAME` are modified.
Now add the changes to commit by `git add`, and issue `git commit`:
```
git add .
git commit
```
The `git commit` command will call the text editor.
Type `modified my info` in the first line, and keep the remaining contents unchanged.
Save and exit the editor, and this finishes a commit.
Now you should see a log labeled with your student ID and name by
```
git log
```
Now switch back to the `master` branch by
```
git checkout master
```
Open `ics2024/Makefile`, and you will find that `STUID` and `STUNAME` are still unchanged!
By issuing `git log`, you will find that the commit log you just created has disappeared!

Don't worry! This is a feature of branches in `git`.
Modifications in different branches are isolated,
which means modifying files in one branch will not affect other branches.
Switch back to `pa0` branch by
```
git checkout pa0
```
You will find that everything comes back!
At the beginning of PA1, you will merge all changes in branch `pa0` into `master`.

The workflow above shows how you will use branch in PAs:
* before starting a new PA, new a branch `pa?` and check out to it
* coding in the branch `pa?` (this will introduce lot of modifications)
* after finish the PA, merge the branch `pa?` into `master`, and check out back to `master`

### Compiling and Running NEMU

Now enter `nemu/` directory.
Before the first time to compile NEMU, a configuration file should be generated by
```
make menuconfig
```

<!-- > #### caution::编译报错了
> 你有可能会遇到这个错误信息, 好吧确实是讲义疏忽了.
> 那就正好当作一个练习吧: 你需要把缺少的工具装上.
>
> 至于怎么装, 当然是STFW了. -->

> #### caution::Compilation error!
> You might get this error message, well it was an oversight in the handout.
> So it's just an exercise: you need to install the missing tool.
>
> As for how to do it, STFW, of course.

A menu will pop up. DO NOT modify anything.
Just choose `Exit` and `Yes` to save the new configuration.
After that, compile the project by `make`:
```
make
```
If nothing goes wrong, NEMU will be compiled successfully.

<!-- > #### comment::确认llvm版本

To perform a fresh compilation, type
```
make clean
```
to remove the old compilation result, then `make` again.

To run NEMU, type
```
make run
```

However, you will see an error message:
```
[src/monitor/monitor.c:35 welcome] Exercise: Please remove me in the source code and compile NEMU again.
riscv32-nemu-interpreter: src/monitor/monitor.c:36: welcome: Assertion `0' failed.
```

This message tells you that the program has triggered an assertion fail
at line 36 of the file `nemu/src/monitor/monitor.c`.
If you do not know what is assertion, blame the 程序设计基础 course.
But just ignore it now, and you will fix it in PA1.

To debug NEMU with gdb, type
```
make gdb
```

### Development Tracing

Once the compilation succeeds, the change of source code will be traced by `git`.
Type
```
git log
```
If you see something like
```
commit 4072d39e5b6c6b6837077f2d673cb0b5014e6ef9

    15:57:01 up 22 days,  6:01, 16 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
```
this means the change is traced successfully.

If you see the following message while executing make, this means the tracing fails.
```
fatal: Unable to create '/home/user/ics2024/.git/index.lock': File exists.

If no other git process is currently running, this probably means a
git process crashed in this repository earlier. Make sure no other git
process is running and remove the file manually to continue.
```
Try to clean the compilation result and compile again:
```
make clean
make
```

### Local Commit

Although the development tracing system will trace the change of your code
after every successful compilation, the trace record is not suitable for your development.
This is because the code is still buggy at most of the time.
Also, it is not easy for you to identify those bug-free traces.
Therefore, you should trace your bug-free code manually.

When you want to commit the change, type
```
git add .
git commit --allow-empty
```
The `--allow-empty` option is necessary,
because usually the change is already committed by development tracing system.
Without this option, `git` will reject no-change commits.
If the commit succeeds, you can see a log labeled with your student ID and name by
```
git log
```

To filter out the commit logs corresponding to your manual commit, use `--author` option with `git log`.
For details about how to use this option, RTFM.

### Writing Report

<!-- > #### danger::实验报告内容
> 你必须在实验报告中描述以下内容:

> * <font color=red>必答题.</font>
>
> 你可以自由选择报告的其它内容. 你不必详细地描述实验过程, 但我们鼓励你在报告中描述如下内容:

## RTFSC and Enjoy

<!-- If you are new to GNU/Linux and finish this tutorial by yourself, congratulations! You have learned a lot!
The most important, you have learned STFW and RTFM for using new tools and trouble-shooting. <font color=red>(反思一下, 你真的做到了吗?)</font>
With these skills, you can solve lots of troubles by yourself during PAs, as well as in the future. -->
If you are new to GNU/Linux and finish this tutorial by yourself, congratulations! You have learned a lot!
The most important, you have learned STFW and RTFM for using new tools and trouble-shooting. <font color=red>(Think about it. Did you really do it?)</font>
With these skills, you can solve lots of troubles by yourself during PAs, as well as in the future.

In PA1, the first thing you will do is to [RTFSC][rtfsc].
If you have troubles during reading the source code, go to RTFM:
* If you can not find the definition of a function, it is probably a library function.
Read `man` for more information about that function.
* If you can not understand the code related to hardware details, refer to the manual.

[rtfsc]: http://i.linuxtoy.org/docs/guide/ch48s06.html

By the way, you will use C language for programming in all PAs.
[Here][c tutorial] is an excellent tutorial about C language.
It contains not only C language (such as how to use `printf()` and `scanf()`),
but also other elements in a computer system
(data structure, computer architecture, assembly language, linking, operating system, network...).
It covers most parts of this course.
You are strongly recommended to read this tutorial.

[c tutorial]: http://akaedu.github.io/book/

Finally, enjoy the journey of PAs,
and you will find hardware is not mysterious, so does the computer system!
But remember:
* <font color=red>STFW</font>
* <font color=red>RTFM</font>
* <font color=red>RTFSC</font>
