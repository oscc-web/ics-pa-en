<!-- > #### caution::基础设施 - 提高项目开发的效率
> 在PA中, 基础设施是指支撑项目开发的各种工具和手段.
> 原则上基础设施并不属于课本知识的范畴,
> 但是作为一个有一定规模的项目, 基础设施的好坏会影响到项目的推进,
> 甚至决定项目的成败, 这是你在程序设计课上体会不到的.
>
> 事实上, 你已经体会过基础设施给你带来的便利了.
> 我们的框架代码已经提供了Makefile来对NEMU进行一键编译.
> 假设我们并没有提供一键编译的功能, 你需要通过手动键入`gcc`命令的方式来编译源文件:
> 假设你手动输入一条`gcc`命令需要10秒的时间(你还需要输入很多编译选项, 能用10秒输入完已经是非常快的了),
> 而NEMU工程下有30个源文件, 为了编译出NEMU的可执行文件, 你需要花费多少时间?
> 然而你还需要在开发NEMU的过程中不断进行编译, 假设你需要编译500次NEMU才能完成PA,
> 一学期下来, 你仅仅花在键入编译命令上的时间有多少?
>
> 有的项目即使使用工具也需要花费较多时间来构建.
> 例如硬件开发平台`vivado`/`quartus`一般需要花费半小时到一小时不等的时间来生成比特文件,
> 也就是说, 你编写完代码之后, 可能需要等待一小时之后才能验证你的代码是否正确.
> 这是因为, 这个过程不像编译程序这么简单, 其中需要处理很多算法上的NPC问题.
> 为了生成一个质量还不错的比特文件, 硬件开发工具需要付出比`gcc`更大的代价来解决这些NPC问题.
> 这时候基础设施的作用就更加重要了, 如果能有工具可以帮助你一次进行多个方面的验证,
> 就会帮助你节省下来无数个"一小时".
>
> Google内部的开发团队非常重视基础设施的建设,
> 他们把可以让一个项目得益的工具称为Adder, 把可以让多个项目得益的工具称为Multiplier.
> 顾名思义, 这些工具可以成倍提高项目开发的效率.
> 在学术界, 不少科研工作的目标也是提高开发效率,
> 例如bug自动检测和修复, 自动化验证, 易于开发的编程模型等等.
> 在PA中, 基础设施也会体现在不同的方面, 我们会在将来对其它方面进行讨论.
>
> 你将来肯定会参与比PA更大的项目, 如何提高项目开发的效率也是一个很重要的问题.
> 希望在完成PA的过程中, 你能够对基础设施有新的认识: <font color=red>有代码的地方, 就有基础设施.</font>

> #### caution::Infrastructure - Improving Efficiency in Project Development
> 
> In PA, infrastructure refers to the tools and instruments that support the development of a project. In principle, infrastructure is not part of textbook knowledge, but as a project of a certain size, the quality of the infrastructure can affect the progress of the project, and even determine the success or failure of the project, which you can not experience in the programming class.
> 
> In fact, you've already experienced what infrastructure can do for you. Our framework code already provides a Makefile for one-click compilation of NEMU. Suppose we don't provide one-click compilation, and you have to manually type in the `gcc` command to compile the source files: Suppose it takes you 10 seconds to manually type in a `gcc` command (you have to type in a lot of compilation options, and 10 seconds is very fast), and there are 30 source files under the NEMU project, how much time would you need to spend in order to compile the NEMU executable? In order to compile the NEMU executable, how much time do you need to spend? However, you also need to develop NEMU with a lot of recompiling, let's say you need to compile NEMU 500 times to complete the PA, with in a semester, how much time you just spend on typing compilation commands?
> 
> Some projects take longer to build even with tools. For example, the `vivado`/`quartus` IDE can take anywhere from half an hour to an hour to generate a bit stream, which means that after you have written the code, you may have to wait up to an hour before you can verify that your code is correct. This is because the process is not as simple as compiling a program, and there are many algorithmic NPC issues to deal with. In order to produce a decent bit stream, the hardware development tools cost more than `gcc` to solve these NPC problems. This is where infrastructure becomes even more important, and having tools that can help you verify multiple aspects at once can save you countless "hours".
> 
> Google's internal development team places a high value on infrastructure, calling tools that benefit one project an Adder, and tools that benefit multiple projects a Multiplier. As the name implies, these tools can multiply the efficiency of a project's development. In academia, the goal of many research efforts is also to improve development efficiency, such as automated bug detection and fixing, automated verification, and easy-to-develop programming models. In PA, the infrastructure also manifests itself in different ways, and we will discuss other aspects in the future.
> 
> You will certainly be involved in larger projects than PA in the future, and the question of how to improve the efficiency of project development is also an important one. Hopefully, in the course of completing PA, you will gain a new understanding of infrastructure: <font color=red>where there's code, there's infrastructure.</font> As you gain knowledge, you may be able to contribute to these uncharted territories and make a difference to developers all over the world.

<!-- > #### comment::真实故事
> yzh的小组里曾经发生过一件由于基础设施不完善而导致在论文投稿截止前科研成果质量不佳的事件.
>
> 这一科研工作需要运行各种不同的测试来验证效果, 在两台4核8线程的PC机上运行完所有的测试需要花费约24小时.
> 每次对设计进行改动之后, 都需要重新运行所有测试, 可以说是, 改一行代码, 要过24小时后才能得到结果.
> 事实上, 在投稿截止3个月之前, 我们已经得知有一台112核的服务器可以使用.
> 如果在这台服务器上部署测试环境, 预计可以使测试总时间减少到原来的1/5
> (多核服务器的主频比PC机低1倍, 架构也落后两代, 1/5是一个综合考虑之后的数字).
>
> 但是带领这一项目的同学并没有意识到基础设施的重要性: 他一直在PC机上进行测试.
> 事实上, 测试总时间减少到原来的1/5, 其实意味着改进设计的机会是原来的5倍.
> 结果到投稿截止之前, 设计还在修改, 测试还在反复运行,
> 最终只能无奈地采用一个质量有待提高的设计版本提交论文. -->
> #### comment::True Stories
> 
> In yzh's group, there was an incident where the quality of the research was not satisfactory before the submission deadline due to poor infrastructure.
> 
> The work required running different tests to verify the results, and it took about 24 hours to run all the tests on two 4-core, 8-thread PCs. Each time a change was made to the design, all the tests had to be re-run, so it took 24 hours to get the results after changing one line of code. In fact, three months before the submission deadline, we learned that a 112-core server was available. Deploying the test environment on this server was expected to reduce the total test time to 1/5 of the original time (1/5 is a comprehensive figure given that multi-core servers has half of the CPU frequency compares to PCs, and the architecture is two generations behind).
> 
> But the student leading the project didn't realize the importance of the infrastructure: he was always testing on a PC. In fact, reducing the total testing time to 1/5th of the original time meant that the chances of improving the design were five times greater. As a result, by the deadline, the design was still being revised, the tests were still being run over and over again, and he had no choice but to submit the paper with a version of the design that needed to be improved.

<!-- 简易调试器(Simple Debugger, sdb)是NEMU中一项非常重要的基础设施.
我们知道NEMU是一个用来执行其它客户程序的程序, 这意味着, NEMU可以随时了解客户程序执行的所有信息.
然而这些信息对外面的调试器(例如GDB)来说, 是不容易获取的.
例如在通过GDB调试NEMU的时候, 你将很难在NEMU中运行的客户程序中设置断点,
但对于NEMU来说, 这是一件不太困难的事情. -->
The Simple Debugger (sdb) is a very important infrastructure in NEMU. We know that NEMU is a program that is used to execute other client programs, which means that NEMU has all the information about the execution of the client program at all times. However, this information is not easily accessible to outside debuggers (e.g., GDB). For example, when debugging NEMU through GDB, you will have a hard time setting breakpoints in a client program running in NEMU, but for NEMU, this is a less difficult task.

<!-- 为了提高调试的效率, 同时也作为熟悉框架代码的练习,
我们需要在monitor中实现一个具有如下功能的简易调试器
(相关部分的代码在`nemu/src/monitor/sdb/`目录下),
如果你不清楚命令的格式和功能, 请参考如下表格: -->
In order to improve the efficiency of debugging, but also as an exercise to familiarize with the framework code, we need to implement a simple debugger with the following functions in monitor (the relevant part of the code in the `nemu/src/monitor/sdb/` directory), if you are not clear about the format and function of the commands, please refer to the following table:

<!-- | 命令 | 格式 | 使用举例 | 说明 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 帮助(1) | `help` | `help` | 打印命令的帮助信息 |
| 继续运行(1) | `c` | `c` | 继续运行被暂停的程序 |
| 退出(1) | `q` | `q` | 退出NEMU |
| 单步执行 | `si [N]` | `si 10` | 让程序单步执行`N`条指令后暂停执行, <br>当`N`没有给出时, 缺省为`1` |
| 打印程序状态 | `info SUBCMD` | `info r`<br>`info w` | 打印寄存器状态<br>打印监视点信息 |
| 扫描内存(2) | `x N EXPR` | `x 10 $esp` | 求出表达式`EXPR`的值, 将结果作为起始内存<br>地址, 以十六进制形式输出连续的`N`个4字节 |
| 表达式求值 | `p EXPR` | `p $eax + 1` | 求出表达式`EXPR`的值, `EXPR`支持的<br>运算请见[调试中的表达式求值](./1.6.md)小节 |
| 设置监视点 | `w EXPR` | `w *0x2000` | 当表达式`EXPR`的值发生变化时, 暂停程序执行 |
| 删除监视点 | `d N` | `d 2` | 删除序号为`N`的监视点 | -->
| Command | Format | Example | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Help(1) | `help` | `help` | Prints help information for the command |
| Continue running(1) | `c` | `c` | Resume running the suspended program |
| Quit(1) | `q` | `q` | Exit NEMU |
| Single-step execution | `si [N]` | `si 10` | Lets the program pause after executing `N` instructions using single step execution, <br>When `N` is not given, the default is `1` |
| Print program status | `info SUBCMD` | `info r`<br>`info w` | Print register status<br>Print watchpoint information |
| Scan memory(2) | `x N EXPR` | `x 10 $esp` | Finds the value of the expression `EXPR`, uses the result as the starting memory<br>address, and outputs consecutive `N` 4 bytes in hexadecimal. |
| Expression evaluation | `p EXPR` | `p $eax + 1` | Find the value of the expression `EXPR`, for `EXPR` supported<br>operations
See the chapter [Expression evaluation in debugging](./1.6.md). |
| Set watchpoint | `w EXPR` | `w *0x2000` | Suspend program execution when the value of expression `EXPR` changes. |
| Deleting a watchpoint | `d N` | `d 2` | Deletes the watchpoint with ID `N`. |

<!-- 备注:
* (1) 命令已实现
* (2) 与GDB相比, 我们在这里做了简化, 更改了命令的格式 -->
Remarks:

* (1) The command has been implemented already.
* (2) Compared to GDB, we have simplified it here by changing the format of the command.

<!-- > #### caution::总有一天会找上门来的bug
> 你需要在将来的PA中使用这些功能来帮助你进行NEMU的调试.
> 如果你的实现是有问题的, 将来你有可能会面临以下悲惨的结局:
> 你实现了某个新功能之后, 打算对它进行测试, 通过扫描内存的功能来查看一段内存, 发现输出并非预期结果.
> 你认为是刚才实现的新功能有问题, 于是对它进行调试.
> 经过了几天几夜的调试之后, 你泪流满面地发现, 原来是扫描内存的功能有bug!
>
> 如果你想避免类似的悲惨结局, 你需要在实现一个功能之后对它进行充分的测试.
> 随着时间的推移, 发现同一个bug所需要的代价会越来越大. -->
> #### caution::Bugs that will find their way to you one day
> 
> You will need to use these features in future PAs to help you debug NEMU. If your implementation is faulty, you may end up with the following scenario: you implement a new feature, test it, scan a section of memory, and find that the output is not what you expected. You think there's something wrong with the new feature you just implemented, so you debug it. After days and nights of debugging, you realize with tears in your eyes that the memory scanning function is buggy!
> 
> If you want to avoid this kind of misery, you need to fully test a feature after you implement it. Over time, the cost of discovering the same bug becomes more and more expensive.

<!-- ### 解析命令 -->
### Parsing Commands

<!-- 为了让简易调试器易于使用,  NEMU通过`readline`库与用户交互, 使用`readline()`函数从键盘上读入命令.
与`gets()`相比, `readline()`提供了"行编辑"的功能, 最常用的功能就是通过上, 下方向键翻阅历史记录.
事实上, shell程序就是通过`readline()`读入命令的.
关于`readline()`的功能和返回值等信息, 请查阅 -->
To make the simple debugger easy to use, NEMU interacts with the user through the `readline` library, which uses the `readline()` function to read commands from the keyboard. In contrast to `gets()`, `readline()` provides "line editing" functionality, most commonly used to scroll through the history using the up and down arrow keys. In fact, shell programs read in commands using `readline()`. For information on the function and return value of `readline()`, see
```
man readline
```

<!-- 从键盘上读入命令后, NEMU需要解析该命令, 然后执行相关的操作.
解析命令的目的是识别命令中的参数,
例如在`si 10`的命令中识别出`si`和`10`, 从而得知这是一条单步执行10条指令的命令.
解析命令的工作是通过一系列的字符串处理函数来完成的, 例如框架代码中的`strtok()`.
`strtok()`是C语言中的标准库函数, 如果你从来没有使用过`strtok()`,
并且打算继续使用框架代码中的`strtok()`来进行命令的解析, 请务必查阅 -->
After reading a command from the keyboard, NEMU needs to parse the command and then perform the relevant action. The purpose of parsing a command is to identify the arguments in the command, for example, identifying `si` and `10` in a `si 10` command, thus knowing that this is a command that executes 10 instructions in a single step. The parsing of commands is accomplished through a series of string processing functions, such as `strtok()` in the framework code. `strtok()` is a standard library function in C. If you have never used `strtok()` before and plan to continue parsing commands using `strtok()` in the framework code, be sure to check out
```
man strtok
```
<!-- 另外, `cmd_help()`函数中也给出了使用`strtok()`的例子.
事实上, 字符串处理函数有很多, 键入以下内容: -->
Also, the `cmd_help()` function gives an example of using `strtok()`. In fact, there are many string manipulation functions, type the following.
```
man 3 str<TAB><TAB>
```
<!-- 其中`<TAB>`代表键盘上的TAB键.
你会看到很多以str开头的函数, 其中有你应该很熟悉的`strlen()`, `strcpy()`等函数.
你最好都先看看这些字符串处理函数的manual page, 了解一下它们的功能,
因为你很可能会用到其中的某些函数来帮助你解析命令.
当然你也可以编写你自己的字符串处理函数来解析命令. -->
where `<TAB>` represents the TAB key on the keyboard. You'll see a lot of functions that start with str, among which you'll be familiar with `strlen()`, `strcpy()`, and so on. It's a good idea to look at the manual page for each of these string manipulation functions to see what they do, because you'll probably need some of them to help you parse commands. You can also write your own string function to parse commands.

<!-- > #### question::如何测试字符串处理函数?
> 你可能会抑制不住编码的冲动: 与其RTFM, 还不如自己写.
> 如果真是这样, 你可以考虑一下, 你会如何测试自己编写的字符串处理函数?
>
> 如果你愿意RTFM, 也不妨思考一下这个问题, 因为你会在PA2中遇到类似的问题. -->
> #### question::How do I test a string manipulation function?
> 
> You may not be able to resist the urge to code: instead of RTFM, you can write your own. If that's the case, consider this: how would you test your own string handler?
> 
> If you're willing to RTFM, think about that, too, because you'll run into similar problems in PA2.

<!-- 另外一个值得推荐的字符串处理函数是`sscanf()`, 它的功能和`scanf()`很类似,
不同的是`sscanf()`可以从字符串中读入格式化的内容, 使用它有时候可以很方便地实现字符串的解析.
如果你从来没有使用过它们, RTFM, 或者STFW. -->
Another recommended string manipulation function is `sscanf()`, which is very similar to `scanf()`, except that `sscanf()` reads formatted content from a string, which is sometimes convenient for string parsing. If you've never used them before, RTFM, or STFW.

<!-- ### 单步执行 -->
### Single-step execution

<!-- 单步执行的功能十分简单, 而且框架代码中已经给出了模拟CPU执行方式的函数,
你只要使用相应的参数去调用它就可以了.
如果你仍然不知道要怎么做, RTFSC. -->
Single-step execution is very simple, and the framework code already gives you a function that simulates CPU execution, so you just call it with the appropriate arguments. If you still don't know how to do this, RTFSC.

<!-- ### 打印寄存器 -->
### Printing Registers

<!-- 打印寄存器就更简单了. 不过既然寄存器的结构是ISA相关的,
我们希望能为简易调试器屏蔽ISA的差异. 框架代码已经为大家准备了如下的API: -->
Printing registers is even simpler. But since the structure of the registers is ISA-dependent, we wanted to abstract the ISA differences for the simple debugger. The framework code has prepared the following API for you:
```
// nemu/src/isa/$ISA/reg.c
void isa_reg_display(void);
```
<!-- 执行`info r`之后, 就调用`isa_reg_display()`,
在里面直接通过`printf()`输出所有寄存器的值即可.
如果你从来没有使用过`printf()`, 请RTFM或者STFW.
如果你不知道要输出什么, 你可以参考GDB中的输出. -->
After executing `info r`, call `isa_reg_display()`, which outputs all the registers directly via `printf()`. If you've never used `printf()` before, RTFM or STFW. If you don't know what to output, you can refer to the output in GDB.

<!-- ### 扫描内存 -->
### Scanning Memory

<!-- 扫描内存的实现也不难, 对命令进行解析之后, 先求出表达式的值.
但你还没有实现表达式求值的功能, 现在可以先实现一个简单的版本:
规定表达式`EXPR`中只能是一个十六进制数, 例如 -->
Scanning memory isn't too difficult to implement. After parsing the command, you first evaluate the expression. But you haven't implemented expression evaluation yet, so for now you can implement a simple version: specify that the expression `EXPR` can only be a hexadecimal number, for example
```
x 10 0x80000000
```
<!-- 这样的简化可以让你暂时不必纠缠于表达式求值的细节.
解析出待扫描内存的起始地址之后, 就可以使用循环将指定长度的内存数据通过十六进制打印出来.
如果你不知道要怎么输出, 同样的, 你可以参考GDB中的输出.
问题是, 我们要如何访问客户计算机的内存数据呢? (答案早就说了喂) -->
This simplification allows you to avoid getting bogged down in the details of expression evaluation for a while. Once you have resolved the starting address of the memory to be scanned, you can use a loop to print out the specified length of memory data in hexadecimal. If you don't know how to do this, again, you can refer to the output in GDB. The question is, how do we access the client computer's memory? (The answer is already there.)

<!-- 实现了扫描内存的功能之后, 你可以打印`0x80000000`或者`0x100000`附近的内存,
你应该会看到程序的代码, 和内置客户程序的内容进行对比, 检查你的实现是否正确. -->
Once you have implemented the scanning of memory, you can print the memory around `0x80000000` or `0x100000`, and you should see the code of the program, compare it with the contents of the built-in client program, and check if you have implemented it correctly.

> 
> [Michael Stonebrakeropen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stonebraker) winner of the 2014 Turing Award, mentioned in an interview that he spent five years developing the world's first relational database system, Ingres. Ingres, 90% of which was spent getting it up and running. In other words, 90% of the time during the development process, the system was not working, was buggy, and needed to be debugged.
> 
> So, let's accept it: bugs are normal, and you need to wake up from the illusion of "code that compiles and runs in a single run" that you felt in your programming experiments back in the day. The important thing is that we need to use the right methods and tools to help us test and debug, and ultimately get the program to run. An example of this is the version control tool `git`, which can track changes in your code to find out when bugs were introduced, and can roll back to the last working version of your program if necessary.
