PA0 is a guide to GNU/Linux development environment configuration.
You are guided to install a GNU/Linux development environment.
All PAs and Labs are done in this environment.
 <font color=red>If you are new to GNU/Linux, and you encounter some troubles during the configuration,
which are not mentioned in this lecture note (such as "No such file or directory"), that is your fault.</font>
Go back to read this lecture note carefully.
 <font color=red>Remember, the machine is always right!</font>

<!-- > #### caution::对, 你没有看错, 除了一些重要的信息之外, PA0的实验讲义都是英文!
> 随着科学技术的发展, 在国际学术交流中使用英语已经成为常态:
> 顶尖的论文无一不使用英文来书写, 在国际上公认的计算机领域经典书籍也是使用英文编著.
> 顶尖的论文没有中文翻译版; 如果需要获取信息, 也应该主动去阅读英文材料, 而不是等翻译版出版.
> "我是中国人, 我只看中文"这类观点已经不符合时代发展的潮流,
> 要站在时代的最前沿, 阅读英文材料的能力是不可或缺的.
>
> 阅读英文材料, 无非就是"不会的单词查字典, 不懂的句子反复读".
> 如今网上有各种词霸可解燃眉之急, 但英文阅读能力的提高贵在坚持.
> "刚开始觉得阅读英文效率低", 是所有中国人都无法避免的经历.
> 如果你发现身边的大神可以很轻松地阅读英文材料, 那是因为他们早就克服了这些困难.
> 引用陈道蓄老师的话: 坚持一年, 你就会发现有不同; 坚持两年, 你就会发现大有不同.
>
> 撇开这些高大上的话题不说, 阅读英文材料和你有什么关系呢?
> 有! 因为在PA中陪伴你的, 就是没有中文版的各种手册(例如[riscv手册][riscv]),
> 当然还有`man`: 如果你不愿意阅读英文材料, 你是注定无法独立完成PA的.
>
> 作为过渡, 我们为大家准备了全英文的PA0.
> PA0的目的是配置实验环境, 同时熟悉GNU/Linux下的工作方式.
> 其中涉及的都是一些操作性的步骤, 你不必为了完成PA0而思考深奥的问题.
> <font color=red>你需要独立完成PA0, 请你认真阅读讲义中的每一个字符, 并按照讲义中的内容进行操作:
> 当讲义提到要在互联网上搜索某个内容时, 你就去互联网上搜索这个内容.
> 如果遇到了错误, 请认真反复阅读讲义内容, <u>机器永远是对的</u>.</font>
> 如果你是第一次使用GNU/Linux, 你还需要查阅大量资料或教程来学习一些新工具的使用方法,
> 这需要花费大量的时间(例如你可能需要花费一个下午的时间, 仅仅是为了使用`vim`在文件中键入两行内容).
> 这就像阅读英文材料一样, 一开始你会觉得效率很低, 但随着时间的推移, 你对这些工具的使用会越来越熟练.
> 相反, 如果你通过"投机取巧"的方式来完成PA0, 你将会马上在PA1中遇到麻烦.
> 正如etone所说, 你在专业上的技不如人, 迟早有一天会找上来.
>
> 另外, PA0的讲义只负责给出操作过程, 并不负责解释这些操作相关的细节和原理.
> 如果你希望了解它们, 请在互联网上搜索相关内容.

> #### caution::Yes, you read that right, except for some important information, the PA0 lab handouts are all in English!
> With the development of science and technology, the use of English in international academic exchanges has become the norm.
> Top papers are invariably written in English, and internationally recognized classics in the field of computing are written in English.
> Top papers are not translated into Chinese; if you need information, you should read it in English rather than wait for a translation to be published.
> "I'm Chinese, I only read Chinese" is no longer the trend of the times, and it is important to be on the cutting edge of the times.
> The ability to read materials in English is indispensable to stay at the forefront of the times.
>
> Reading English materials is simply a matter of "looking up words you don't know in the dictionary, and reading sentences you don't understand over and over again".
> Nowadays, there are all kinds of dictionaries available on the Internet, but improving your English reading skills is a matter of persistence.
> "At first, I felt inefficient in reading English" is an unavoidable experience for all Chinese people.
> If you find yourself surrounded by great readers who can read English materials with ease, it's because they've already overcome these difficulties.
> To quote Mr. Chen Daoxu: stick with it for one year, and you'll see a difference; stick with it for two years, and you'll see a big difference.
>
> Leaving aside these lofty topics, what does reading English materials have to do with you?
> Yes! Because what accompanies you in PA is that there are no Chinese versions of various manuals (e.g. [riscv manual](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/draft-20210813-7d0006e/riscv-spec. pdf)).
> And of course `man': if you are not willing to read English materials, you are not destined to complete PA on your own.
>
> As a transition, we have prepared a full English version of PA0.
> The purpose of PA0 is to configure the environment and familiarize yourself with how things work under GNU/Linux.
> The steps involved are operational, and you don't need to think about deep questions in order to complete PA0.
> <font color=red>You need to complete PA0 on your own, so please read each character in the handout carefully and follow the instructions:
> When the handout mentions searching for something on the Internet, you search for it on the Internet.
> If you make a mistake, please read the handout carefully and repeatedly, <u>The machine is always right</u>.</font>
> If you are a first time user of GNU/Linux, you will need to consult a lot of information or tutorials to learn how to use some of the new tools.
> This takes a lot of time (e.g. you might need to spend an afternoon, just to type two lines in a file using `vim`).
> It's like reading material in English, you'll feel inefficient at first, but over time you'll become more and more proficient with these tools.
> On the contrary, if you complete your PA0 by "tricking" yourself, you will immediately run into trouble in PA1.
> As etone said, your professional inferiority will come back to haunt you sooner or later.
>
> Also, PA0's handouts only give procedures, they do not explain the details and principles of these operations.
> If you want to know about them, please search for them on the Internet.

We are going to install the [Ubuntu 22.04][ubuntu] distribution directly over your physical machine.
If you already have one copy of GNU/Linux distribution,
and you want to use your copy as the development environment, just use it!
But if you encounter some troubles because of platform disparity,
please search the Internet for trouble-shooting.

It is also OK to use virtual machines, such as VMWare or VirtualBox.
If you decide to do this and you do not have a copy of GNU/Linux,
please install [Ubuntu][ubuntu] distribution in the virtual machine.
Also, please search the Internet for trouble-shooting if you have any problems about virtual machines.

[ubuntu]: https://ubuntu.com

<!-- > #### danger::必须使用带GUI的64位GNU/Linux
> 如果你打算使用已有的GNU/Linux平台, 请确保它是64位版本.
> PA的某些特性会依赖于64位平台和图形显示.
 -->
> #### danger::You must use 64-bit GNU/Linux with a GUI.
> If you plan to use an existing GNU/Linux platform, make sure it is 64-bit. Some features of PA will depend on 64-bit platforms and graphical displays.


<!-- > #### hint::使用GNU/Linux真机的一些原因
> * 真机的稳定性会比虚拟机相对高一些(比如[crash consistency][crash consistency]之类的).
> * 真机的性能会比虚拟机相对高一些(但不影响实验分数),
>   如果你希望在实验后期获得比较流畅的游戏体验, 真机是一个不错的选择

[crash consistency]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_consistency -->

> #### hint::Some reasons to use a native GNU/Linux machine(not a VM).
> * A real machine is more stable than a virtual machine (e.g. [crash consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_consistency), etc.).
> * The performance of a real machine will be higher than a virtual machine (but it doesn't affect the experiment score),
> * The real machine is a good choice if you want to get a smoother gaming experience in the later stages of the experiment.

<!-- > #### hint::建议体验真机的安装
> 虽然学习计算机专业不是为了修电脑装系统,
> 但如果你连系统都没装过, 也确实不太好意思跟亲戚说你是学计算机的.
> 现在机会来了, 如果你以前真的从来没有安装过操作系统,
> 我们强烈建议你装一下真机, 来了解一下安装操作系统都需要经历些什么. -->
> #### hint::Recommended to experience the OS installation on real machine
> Although you don't study computer science to fix computers and install systems, it's not a good idea to tell your relatives you're in computer science program while you've never installed an OS.
> Now is your chance, if you have never installed an operating system before,
> We strongly recommend that you try install an OS on a real computer to get a feel for what it takes to install an operating system.

<!-- > #### hint::Mac用户的不幸
> 与ICS同时开设的数字电路实验课程需要安装`Vivado/Quartus`工具来进行实验,
> 然而非常不幸的是, 这两款工具皆不提供Mac版本.
> 为了使用它们, 你必须安装Windows或者GNU/Linux操作系统.
> 那么, 还不如一石二鸟, 现在装个GNU/Linux真机, 就可以解决上述所有问题了.
>
> 如果你不必修读南京大学的课程, 可以忽略这个问题. -->

> #### hint::Mac users' misfortune
> The digital circuits lab course offered in conjunction with ICS requires the `Vivado/Quartus` tools to perform the labs, but unfortunately neither of these tools is available for the Mac.
> Unfortunately, neither of these tools is available for Mac.
> In order to use them, you have to install Windows or GNU/Linux.
> So, why not kill two birds with one stone, and install a real GNU/Linux machine now, and solve all the above problems.
>
> If you don't have to take the NJU course, you can ignore this problem.

## Preparation

<!-- > #### danger::首先当然是备份重要数据!
> 如果你是第一次安装操作系统, 你可能会因为误操作而删除了磁盘上的重要文件.
> 备份数据无疑是一个非常重要的操作, 这样以后你就可以在安装过程中进行各种尝试,
> 随心所欲地折腾你的机器了.
>
> 当然, 就算你安装系统的操作看上去是正确的, 也有可能因为硬件兼容问题导致操作系统无法启动等后果.
> 如果确实发生了这种情况, 就到互联网上搜索解决方案吧.
> 因此, PA0还是要尽早开始体验. -->

> #### danger:: First of all, of course, backup your important data!
> If you are installing an operating system for the first time, you may have deleted important files on your disk by mistake.
> Backing up your data is definitely a very important operation, so that later on you can experiment with the installation process and do whatever you want with it.
>
> Of course, even if your installation appears to be correct, it is possible that a hardware compatibility issue may prevent the operating system from booting.
> If this does happen, search the Internet for a solution.
> Therefore, it's important to get started with PA0 as soon as possible.

Please reserve at least one partitions (20GB ~ 50GB) on the disk for Ubuntu to install.
If you want to install `Vivado/Quartus` in Ubuntu,
please reserve about 100GB of disk space.
For how to do this, please search the Internet.
For example, if you use Windows, you can search for `压缩卷 Windows`.

## Installing Ubuntu

<!-- Please search the Internet for "Ubuntu 22.04 安装教程" and follow the tutorial. -->
Please search the Internet for "Ubuntu 22.04 installation" and follow the tutorial.

<!-- > #### hint::我可以选择其它Ubuntu的版本吗?
> 可以. 不过不同版本的Ubuntu中的工具版本会稍有差异, 尤其是编译器GCC.
> 如果你选择了其它版本, 可能会遇到因此带来的少量问题, 不过这不会对实验内容产生大幅的影响. -->
> #### hint::Can I choose another version of Ubuntu?
> Yes, you can. However, the version of tools in different versions of Ubuntu may differ slightly, especially the compiler GCC.
> If you choose a different version, you may encounter a few problems with it, but this will not significantly affect the experiment.

<!-- > #### danger::选择语言时选择English, 不要选择中文
> 使用中文的系统环境会给一些命令行操作带来不便, 甚至会增加排查错误的难度.
> 每年都有部分同学因为选择了中文环境, 在工具报错时无法在互联网上搜索到有效的解决方案,
> 从而影响了实验进度.
>
> 事实上, 即使在英文的系统环境中, 也可以通过安装中文输入法来键入中文. -->
> #### danger::Select English, not Chinese, when choosing a language.
> Using Chinese system environment will bring inconvenience to some command line operations, and even increase the difficulty of troubleshooting errors.
> Every year, some students who choose Chinese environment are unable to find effective solutions on the Internet when the tool reports errors, which affects the progress of the experiment.
>
> In fact, even in an English system, it is possible to type in Chinese by installing a Chinese output method.

<!-- > #### danger::不要使用Ubuntu的Software Updater
> 在完成安装并初次登陆Ubuntu时, Software Updater会弹出提示框提醒用户更新软件(如下图所示),
> 请<font color=red>务必忽略该提示框, 不要点击"安装"</font>.
> 否则安装操作将会改变Ubuntu中包管理器的状态,
> 使其与讲义后续指示的操作产生冲突, 最终将导致系统崩溃而无法再次进入Ubuntu.
>
> ![Ubuntu Software Updater](./images/ubuntu-software-updater.png)
>
> 建议关闭Software Updater功能使其不再提示, 具体操作请在互联网中搜索解决方案.
> 感谢2020级彭浩伦同学发现此问题. -->

> #### danger::Do not use Ubuntu's Software Updater
> After completing the installation and logging in to Ubuntu for the first time, Software Updater will pop up a reminder box to remind the user to update the software (as shown in the figure below)
> Be sure to <font color=red>ignore the prompt and do not click "Install"</font>.
> Otherwise the installation will change the state of the package manager in Ubuntu.
> This will conflict with the subsequent instructions in the handout, and will eventually cause the system to crash and not be accessible again.
>
> ![Ubuntu Software Updater](./images/ubuntu-software-updater.png)
>
> It is recommended to disable the Software Updater function so that it does not prompt you, please search for a solution on the Internet.
> Thank you to Ho-Lun Peng, Class of 2020, for identifying this issue.
