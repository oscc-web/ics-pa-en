<!-- ## 批处理系统 -->

## Batch processing system

<!-- 我们在PA2中已经实现了一个冯诺依曼计算机系统, 并且已经在AM上把打字游戏和FCEUX运行起来了.
有了IOE, 就几乎能把各种小游戏移植到AM上来运行了.
这些小游戏在计算机上的运行模式有一个特点, 它们会独占整个计算机系统:
我们可以在NEMU上一直玩打字游戏, 不想玩的时候,
我们就会退出NEMU, 然后重新运行FCEUX来玩. -->

In PA2, we have already implemented a von Neumann computer system and have managed to run typing games and FCEUX on AM. With IOE, we can almost port various small games to run on AM. These small games runs on the computer in the following way: they monopolize the entire computer system. We can keep playing the typing game on NEMU, and when we don’t want to play anymore, we exit NEMU and then rerun FCEUX to play.

<!-- 事实上, 早期的计算机就是这样工作的:
系统管理员给计算机加载一个特定的程序(其实是上古时期的打孔卡片),
计算机就会一直执行这个程序, 直到程序结束或者是管理员手动终止,
然后再由管理员来手动加载下一个程序.
当年的程序也远远不如你玩的超级玛丽这么酷炫,
大多都是一些科学计算和物理建模的任务(比如弹道轨迹计算). -->

In fact, early computers worked like this:
The system administrator would load a specific program (actually punch cards from ancient times) into the computer,
and the computer would keep executing this program until the program ended or the administrator manually terminated it,
then the administrator would manually load the next program.
The programs back then were far from as cool as the Super Mario you play,
mostly tasks like scientific calculations and physical modeling (such as ballistic trajectory calculations).

<!-- 后来人们就想, 每次都要管理员来手动加载新的程序, 这太麻烦了.
回想起冯诺依曼计算机的工作方式, 它的其中一个特点就是:
当计算机执行完一条指令的时候, 就自动执行下一条指令.
类似的, 我们能不能让管理员事先准备好一组程序,
让计算机执行完一个程序之后, 就自动执行下一个程序呢? -->

Later, people thought that having an administrator manually load new programs each time was too troublesome. Recalling the working method of the von Neumann computer, one of its features is: when the computer finishes executing one instruction, it automatically executes the next one. Similarly, can we let the administrator prepare a set of programs in advance, so that after the computer finishes executing one program, it automatically executes the next one?

<!-- 这就是[批处理][batch processing]系统的思想, 有了批处理系统之后,
就可以解放管理员的双手了. 而批处理系统的关键, 就是要有一个后台程序,
当一个前台程序执行结束的时候, 后台程序就会自动加载一个新的前台程序来执行.

[batch processing]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing -->

This is the idea of a [batch processing][batch processing] system. With the batch processing system, it can free up the administrators' hands. The key to the batch processing system is to have a background program that automatically loads a new foreground program for execution when one foreground program finishes execution.

[batch processing]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing

<!-- 这样的一个后台程序, 其实就是操作系统.
对, 你没有听错, 这个听上去好像什么都没做的后台程序, 真的是操作系统!
说起操作系统, 也许你会马上想到安装包都有几个GB的Windows.
但实际上, 历史上最早投入使用的操作系统[GM-NAA I/O][gm-naa io]在1956年就诞生了,
而它的一个主要任务, 就是上文提到的"自动加载新程序", 具体又需要实现以下两点功能:
* 用户程序执行结束之后, 可以跳转到操作系统的代码继续执行
* 操作系统可以加载一个新的用户程序来执行

[gm-naa io]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM-NAA_I/O -->

Such a background program is actually an operating system. Yes, you heard it right. This background program, which seems to do nothing, is really an operating system! Speaking of operating systems, you might immediately think of Windows, whose installation packages are several GB in size. However, in reality, the earliest operating system put into use, [GM-NAA I/O][gm-naa io], was born in 1956. One of its main tasks was the aforementioned "automatic loading of new programs", which specifically required the implementation of the following two functions:

* After the user program finishes execution, it can jump to the operating system's code to continue execution
* The operating system can load a new user program to execute

<!-- ### 来自操作系统的新需求 -->

### New Requirements from the Operating System

<!-- 仔细思考, 我们就会发现, 上述两点功能中其实蕴含着一个新的需求: 程序之间的执行流切换.
我们知道函数调用一般是在一个程序内部发生的(动态链接库除外),
属于程序内部的执行流切换, 使用call/jal指令即可实现.
而上述两点需求需要在操作系统和用户程序之间进行执行流的切换.
不过, 执行流切换的本质, 也只是把PC从一个值修改成另一个值而已(黑客眼中就是这么理解的).
那么, 我们能否也使用call/jal指令来实现程序之间的执行流切换呢? -->

If we think carefully, we will find that the above two functions actually contain a new requirement: control flow switching between programs. We know that function calls generally occur within a program (except for dynamically linked libraries), which belongs to the internal control flow of the program and can be implemented using the `call`/`jal` instructions. However, the above two requirements need to switch the control flow between the operating system and user programs. Nevertheless, the essence of control flow switching is just modifying the PC from one value to another (this is how hackers understand it). So, can we also use the `call`/`jal` instructions to implement control flow switching between programs?

<!-- 也许在GM-NAA I/O诞生的那个年代, 大家说不定还真是这样做的:
操作系统就是一个库函数, 用户程序退出的时候,
调用一下这个特殊的库函数就可以了, 就像我们在AM的程序中调用`halt()`一样.
不过, 后来人们逐渐认识到, 操作系统和其它用户程序还是不太一样的:
一个用户程序出错了, 操作系统可以运行下一个用户程序;
但如果操作系统崩溃了, 整个计算机系统都将无法工作.
所以, 人们还是希望能把操作系统保护起来, 尽量保证它可以正确工作. -->

Perhaps in the era when GM-NAA I/O was born, people might have actually done it this way: the operating system was a library function, and when the user program exited, it just needed to call this special library function, just like how we call `halt()` in our AM programs. However, later on, people gradually realized that the operating system is still quite different from other user programs: if a user program goes wrong, the operating system can run the next user program; but if the operating system crashes, the entire computer system will be unable to work. Therefore, people still hope to protect the operating system and ensure that it can work correctly as much as possible.

<!-- 在这个需求面前, 用call/jal指令来进行操作系统和用户进程之间的切换就显得太随意了.
操作系统的本质也是一个程序, 也是由函数构成的, 但无论用户程序是无意还是有心,
我们都不希望它可以把执行流切换到操作系统中的任意函数.
我们所希望的, 是一种可以限制入口的执行流切换方式,
显然, 这种方式是无法通过程序代码来实现的. -->

Faced with this requirement, using `call`/`jal` instructions to switch between the operating system and user processes seems too casual. The essence of an operating system is also a program, composed of functions, but regardless of whether the user program is unintentional or intentional, we do not want it to be able to switch the control flow to any function in the operating system. What we hope for is a way to switch the control flow with restricted entry points, which obviously cannot be achieved through program code.

<!-- ### 等级森严的制度 -->

### A Strict Hierarchical System

<!-- 为了阻止程序将执行流切换到操作系统的任意位置, 硬件中逐渐出现保护机制相关的功能,
比如i386中引入了保护模式(protected mode)和特权级(privilege level)的概念,
而mips32处理器可以运行在内核模式和用户模式,
riscv32则有机器模式(M-mode), 监控者模式(S-mode)和用户模式(U-mode).
这些概念的思想都是类似的: 简单地说,
只有高特权级的程序才能去执行一些系统级别的操作,
如果一个特权级低的程序尝试执行它没有权限执行的操作,
CPU将会抛出一个异常信号, 来阻止这一非法行为的发生.
一般来说, 最适合担任系统管理员的角色就是操作系统了, 它拥有最高的特权级, 可以执行所有操作;
而除非经过允许, 运行在操作系统上的用户程序一般都处于最低的特权级,
如果它试图破坏社会的和谐, 它将会被判"死刑". -->

In order to prevent programs from switching the execution flow to arbitrary locations in the operating system, hardware gradually introduced protection mechanisms and related features. For example, the i386 introduced the concepts of protected mode and privilege levels, while the mips32 processor can run in kernel mode and user mode, and riscv32 has machine mode (M-mode), supervisor mode (S-mode), and user mode (U-mode). The ideas behind these concepts are similar: only programs with higher privilege levels can perform certain system-level operations. If a program with a lower privilege level attempts to perform an operation that it does not have permission to execute, the CPU will throw an exception signal to prevent this illegal behavior from occurring. Generally speaking, the most suitable role for a system administrator is the operating system itself, which has the highest privilege level and can perform all operations. Unless specifically allowed, user programs running on the operating system generally have the lowest privilege level. If they attempt to disrupt social harmony, they will be sentenced to "death".

<!-- 以支持现代操作系统的RISC-V处理器为例, 它们存在M, S, U三个特权模式,
分别代表机器模式, 监管者模式和用户模式.
M模式特权级最高, U模式特权级最低, 低特权级能访问的资源, 高特权级也能访问.
那CPU是怎么判断一个进程是否执行了无权限操作呢?
答案很简单, 只要在硬件上维护一个用于标识当前特权模式的寄存器(属于计算机状态的一部分),
然后在访问那些高特权级才能访问的资源时, 对当前特权模式进行检查.
例如RISC-V中有一条特权指令`sfence.vma`, 手册要求只有当处理器当前的特权模式不低于S模式才能执行,
因此我们可以在硬件上添加一些简单的逻辑来实现特权模式的检查:
```
is_sfence_vma_ok = (priv_mode == M_MODE) || (priv_mode == S_MODE);
```
可以看到, 特权模式的检查只不过是一些门电路而已.
如果检查不通过, 此次操作将会被判定为非法操作,
CPU将会抛出异常信号, 并跳转到一个和操作系统约定好的内存位置, 交由操作系统进行后续处理. -->

Taking RISC-V processors that support modern operating systems as an example, they have three privilege modes: M, S, and U, representing machine mode, supervisor mode, and user mode, respectively. M mode has the highest privilege level, while U mode has the lowest. Resources that can be accessed by lower privilege levels can also be accessed by higher privilege levels. So how does the CPU determine whether a process has executed an unauthorized operation? The answer is simple. It only needs to maintain a register in hardware to identify the current privilege mode (which is part of the computer's state), and then check the current privilege mode when accessing resources that can only be accessed by higher privilege levels. For example, RISC-V has a privileged instruction `sfence.vma`, and the manual requires that it can only be executed when the processor's current privilege mode is not lower than S mode. Therefore, we can add some simple logic in hardware to implement the privilege mode check:
```
is_sfence_vma_ok = (priv_mode == M_MODE) || (priv_mode == S_MODE);
```
As we can see, the privilege mode check is nothing more than some gate circuits. If the check fails, this operation will be judged as an illegal operation. The CPU will throw an exception signal and jump to a memory location agreed upon with the operating system, handing it over to the operating system for subsequent processing.

<!-- 通常来说, 操作系统运行在S模式, 因此有权限访问所有的代码和数据;
而一般的程序运行在U模式, 这就决定了它只能访问U模式的代码和数据.
这样, 只要操作系统将其私有代码和数据放S模式中, 恶意程序就永远没有办法访问到它们. -->

Typically, the operating system runs in S mode, so it has permission to access all code and data. On the other hand, ordinary programs run in U mode, which means they can only access code and data in U mode. This way, as long as the operating system puts its private code and data in S mode, malicious programs will never be able to access them.

<!-- 类似地, x86的操作系统运行在ring 0, 用户进程运行在ring 3;
mips32的操作系统运行在内核模式, 用户进程运行在用户模式.
这些保护相关的概念和检查过程都是通过硬件实现的,
只要软件运行在硬件上面, 都无法逃出这一天网.
硬件保护机制使得恶意程序永远无法全身而退, 为构建计算机和谐社会作出了巨大的贡献. -->

Similarly, the operating system on x86 runs in ring 0, while user processes run in ring 3. On mips32, the operating system runs in kernel mode, and user processes run in user mode. These protection-related concepts and check processes are all implemented through hardware. As long as software runs on top of hardware, it cannot escape this net. The hardware protection mechanism ensures that malicious programs can never get away unscathed, making a huge contribution to building a harmonious computer society.

<!-- 这是多美妙的功能! 遗憾的是, 上面提到的很多概念其实只是一带而过,
真正的保护机制也还需要考虑更多的细节.
ISA手册中一般都会专门有一章来描述保护机制, 这就已经看出来保护机制并不是简单说说而已.
根据KISS法则, 我们并不打算在NEMU中加入保护机制.
我们让所有用户进程都运行在最高特权级, 虽然所有用户进程都有权限执行所有指令,
不过由于PA中的用户程序都是我们自己编写的, 一切还是在我们的控制范围之内.
毕竟, 我们也已经从上面的故事中体会到保护机制的本质了:
在硬件中加入一些与特权级检查相关的门电路(例如比较器电路), 如果发现了非法操作,
就会抛出一个异常信号, 让CPU跳转到一个约定好的目标位置, 并进行后续处理. -->

What a wonderful feature! Unfortunately, many of the concepts mentioned above are just briefly touched upon, and a real protection mechanism still needs to consider more details. ISA manuals generally have a dedicated chapter to describe the protection mechanism, which shows that the protection mechanism is not just a simple matter of talking about it. According to the KISS principle, we do not intend to add a protection mechanism in NEMU. We let all user processes run at the highest privilege level. Although all user processes have permission to execute all instructions, since the user programs in PA are all written by ourselves, everything is still within our control. After all, we have already grasped the essence of the protection mechanism from the story above: adding some gate circuits related to privilege level checks (such as comparator circuits) in the hardware. If an illegal operation is detected, it will throw an exception signal, causing the CPU to jump to an agreed-upon target location and perform subsequent processing.

> #### comment:: The Disintegrating Order
> Privilege level protection is a core mechanism of modern computer systems, but having this strict hierarchical system does not mean that we can rest easy. Hackers always rack their brains to probe the boundaries of this system. The most recent big events in the cybersecurity field are the two infamous hardware vulnerabilities, [Meltdown and Spectre][meltdown], which were exposed in January 2018. These two epic-level vulnerabilities shocked the world because they broke the boundaries of privilege levels: under certain conditions, malicious programs can steal information from the operating system at an extremely high rate. Intel's chips were pointed out to have the Meltdown vulnerability, while the Spectre vulnerability endangers chips of all architectures, with no exceptions. They can be said to be the two most impactful vulnerabilities in the history of computer architecture so far. If you execute `cat /proc/cpuinfo`, you may see the shadow of these two vulnerabilities in the `bugs` information.
>
> Meltdown and Spectre sounded the alarm for those chip designers who had been blindly pursuing performance in the past: without security, no matter how fast the chip runs, it is in vain. Interestingly, the ones who directly paid for this farce were the engineers of major cloud computing platforms: in the week when the vulnerabilities were exposed, engineers from Alibaba Cloud and Microsoft Azure worked overtime for several consecutive nights, trying every means to patch the cloud platforms to prevent customers' data from being maliciously stolen.
>
> However, as a teaching experiment, the topic of security is still too far away from PA, and even performance is not the main goal of PA. The point of this example is that real computer systems are very complex and far from perfect. The emergence of these vulnerabilities also indicates to a certain extent that people can no longer fully understand the mutual influence between each module all at once. But the principles behind computers are all inherited from the same origin. Understanding these principles in a small and refined teaching system, and then understanding and improving real systems, is also a valuable gain from doing PA.
