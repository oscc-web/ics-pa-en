## Configuring vim

```
apt-get install vim
```
<!-- `vim` is called [编辑器之神][vim].
You will use `vim` for coding in atrigger pipeline editing other files.

### Learning vim

You are going to be asked to modify a file using `vim`.
For most of you, this is the first time to use `vim`.
The operations in `vim` are quite different from other editors you have ever used.
To learn `vim`, you need a tutorial.
There are two ways to get tutorials:
* Issue the `vimtutor` command in terminal. This will launch a tutorial for `vim`.
 <font color=red>This way is recommended, since you can read the tutorial and practice at the same time.</font>
* Search the Internet with keyword "vim 教程", and you will find a lot of tutorials about `vim`.
Choose some of them to read, meanwhile you can practice with the a temporary file by
```
vim test
```

<font color=red>PRACTICE IS VERY IMPORTANT. You can not learn anything by only reading the tutorials.</font>

> #### comment::The power of vim
> You may never consider what can be done in such a "BAD" editor. Let's see two examples.
>
> The first example is to generate the following file:
> ```
> 1
> 2
> 3
> .....
> 98
> 99
> 100
> ```
> This file contains 100 lines, and each line contains a number.
> What will you do? In `vim`, this is a piece of cake.
> First change `vim` into normal state (when `vim` is just opened, it is in normal state),
> then press the following keys sequentially:
> ```
> i1<ESC>q1yyp<C-a>q98@1
> ```
> where `<ESC>` means the ESC key, and `<C-a>` means "Ctrl + a" here.
> You only press no more than 15 keys to generate this file.
> Is it amazing? What about a file with 1000 lines? What you do is just to press one more key:
> ```
> i1<ESC>q1yyp<C-a>q998@1
> ```
> The magic behind this example is recording and replaying.
> You initial the file with the first line.
> Then record the generation of the second.
> After that, you replay the generation for 998 times to obtain the file.
>
> The second example is to modify a file. Suppose you have such a file:
> ```
> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
> cccccccccccccccccccccccccddddddddddddddddddddddddd
> eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefffffffffffffffffffffffff
> ggggggggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
> iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiijjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
> ```
> You want to modify it into:
> ```

> dddddddddddddddddddddddddccccccccccccccccccccccccc
> fffffffffffffffffffffffffeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
> hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhggggggggggggggggggggggggg
> jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
> ```
> What will you do? In `vim`, this is a piece of cake, too.

### Enabling syntax highlight

`vim` provides more improvements comparing with `vi`.
But these improvements are disabled by default.
Therefore, you should enable them first.

We take syntax highlight as an example to illustrate how to enable the features of `vim`.
To do this, you should modify the `vim` configuration file.
The file is called `.vimrc`, and it is located under `/etc/vim` directory.
We first make a copy of it to the home directory by `cp` command:
```
cp /etc/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
And switch to the home directory if you are not under it yet:
```
cd ~
```
If you use `ls` to list files, you will not see the `.vimrc` you just copied.
This is because a file whose name starts with a `.` is a hidden file in GNU/Linux.
To show hidden files, use `ls` with `-a` option:
```
ls -a
```
Then open `.vimrc` using `vim`:
```
vim .vimrc
```

After you learn some basic operations in `vim` (such as moving, inserting text, deleting text),
you can try to modify the `.vimrc` file as following:
```diff
--- before modification
+++ after modification
@@ -17,3 +17,3 @@
 " Vim5 and later versions support syntax highlighting. Uncommenting the next
 " line enables syntax highlighting by default.
-"syntax on
+syntax on
```

We present the modification with [GNU diff format][diff].
If you do not understand the diff format, please search the Internet for more information.

After you are done, you should save your modification.
Exit `vim` and open the `.vimrc` file again, you should see the syntax highlight feature is enabled.
