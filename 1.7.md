<!-- ## 如何阅读手册 -->
## How to read the manual

<!-- 在以后的PA中, 你需要反复阅读之前获得的生存手册.
鉴于有同学片面地认为"看手册"就是"把手册全看一遍", 因而觉得"不可能在短时间内看完",
我们在PA1的最后来聊聊如何科学地看手册. -->
You will need to read your previously acquired survival manual over and over again in your future PAs.
Since some students think that "reading the manual" means "reading the whole manual" and therefore "it is impossible to finish it in a short time", we will talk about how to read the manual scientifically at the end of PA1.

<!-- ### 学会使用目录 -->
### Learn to use the table of contents

<!-- 了解一本书都有哪些内容的最快方法就是查看目录, 尤其是当你第一次看一本新书的时候.
查看目录之后并不代表你知道它们具体在说什么, 但你会对这些内容有一个初步的印象,
提到某一个概念的时候, 你可以大概知道这个概念会在手册中的哪些章节出现.
这对查阅手册来说是极其重要的, 因为我们每次查阅手册的时候总是关注某一个问题,
如果每次都需要把手册从头到尾都看一遍才能确定关注的问题在哪里, 效率是十分低下的.
事实上也没有人会这么做, 阅读目录的重要性可见一斑.
纸上得来终觉浅, 还是来动手体会一下吧! -->
The fastest way to find out what's in a book is to look at the table of contents, especially if it's your first time reading a new book.
Looking at the table of contents doesn't mean you know exactly what it says, but it does give you a first impression of what's in it, and when a concept is mentioned, you can get a rough idea of where it will appear in the manual.
This is extremely important for reviewing the manual, because we always focus on one issue every time we review the manual, and if we have to go through the manual from the beginning every time, we can't do that.
It would be very inefficient to read the manual from cover to cover to determine what the concern is.
In fact, no one would ever do that, so the importance of reading the table of contents is obvious.
It's not as easy as it sounds on paper, so let's do it!

<!-- > #### todo::尝试通过目录定位关注的问题
> 假设你现在需要了解一个叫`selector`的概念, 请通过i386手册的目录确定你需要阅读手册中的哪些地方.
> 即使你选择的ISA并不是x86, 也可以尝试去查阅这个概念. -->
> #### todo::Trying to locate concerns through the table of contents
> Assuming that you now need to understand a concept called `selector`, go through the table of contents of the i386 manual to determine where you need to read the manual.
> Even if your ISA of choice isn't x86, try checking out this concept as well.

<!-- 怎么样, 是不是很简单?
虽然你还是不明白`selector`是什么, 但你已经知道你需要阅读哪些地方了,
要弄明白`selector`, 那也是指日可待的事情了. -->
Well, isn't that simple?
You still don't know what a `selector` is, but you know what you need to read.
It's just a matter of time before you figure out what is `selector`.

<!-- ### 逐步细化搜索范围 -->
### Progressive refining of the scope of the search

<!-- 有时候你关注的问题不一定直接能在目录里面找到, 例如"CR0寄存器的PG位的含义是什么".
这种细节的问题一般都是出现在正文中, 而不会直接出现在目录中,
因此你就不能直接通过目录来定位相应的内容了.
根据你是否第一次接触CR0, 查阅这个问题会有不同的方法:
* 如果你已经知道CR0是个control register, 你可以直接在目录里面查看"control register"所在的章节,
然后在这些章节的正文中寻找"CR0".
* 如果你对CR0一无所知, 你可以使用阅读器中的搜索功能, 搜索"CR0", 还是可以很快地找到"CR0"的相关内容.
不过最好的方法是首先使用搜索引擎, 你可以马上知道"CR0是个control register", 然后就可以像第一种方法那样查阅手册了. -->
Sometimes the question you are concerned about may not be found directly in the table of contents, e.g., "What is the meaning of the PG bit in the CR0 register".
This kind of detail is usually found in the body of the text, not directly in the table of contents, so you can't go through the table of contents to locate it.
So you can't go through the table of contents directly to locate the appropriate content.
Depending on whether you are new to CR0 or not, there are different ways to find out about this issue.
* If you already know that CR0 is a control register, you can look directly in the table of contents for the section where the "control register" is located, and then look in the body of those sections.
* If you do not know anything about CR0, you can use the search function in the reader, search for "CR0", you can still quickly find "CR0" related content.
But the best way is to use the search engine first, so you know immediately that "CR0 is a control register", and then you can consult the manual as in the first method.

<!-- 不过有时候, 你会发现一个概念在手册中的多个地方都有提到.
这时你需要明确你要关心概念的哪个方面, 通常一个概念的某个方面只会在手册中的一个地方进行详细的介绍.
你需要在这多个地方中进行进一步的筛选, 但至少你已经过滤掉很多与这个概念无关的章节了.
筛选也是有策略的, 你不需要把多个地方的所有内容全部阅读一遍才能进行筛选,
小标题, 每段的第一句话, 图表的注解, 这些都可以帮助你很快地了解这一部分的内容大概在讲什么.
这不就是高中英语考试中的快速阅读吗?
对的, 就是这样. 如果你觉得目前还缺乏这方面的能力, 现在锻炼的好机会来了. -->
Sometimes, however, you may find that a concept is mentioned in more than one place in the manual.
You need to be clear about which aspect of the concept you want to focus on, and usually a particular aspect of a concept will only be covered in detail in one place in the manual.
You'll need to sift through the multiple places, but at least you've filtered out a lot of sections that aren't relevant to the concept.
Filtering is also strategic, and you don't need to read everything in multiple places to filter.
Subheadings, the first sentence of each paragraph, and notes on charts and graphs can help you get a quick sense of what the section is about.
Isn't this the same kind of fast reading that was used on the high school English test?
Yes, it is. If you think you're lacking in this area, here's your chance to practice.

<!-- 搜索和筛选信息是一个trial and error的过程, 没有什么方法能够指导你在第一遍搜索就能成功, 但还是有经验可言的.
搜索失败的时候, 你应该尝试使用不同的关键字重新搜索.
至于怎么变换关键字, 就要看你对问题核心的理解了, 换句话说, 怎么问才算是切中要害.
这不就是高中语文强调的表达能力吗? 对的, 就是这样. -->
Searching and sifting through information is a trial and error process, and there is no way to guide you to success on the first search, but there are lessons to be learned.
When a search fails, you should try searching again with different keywords.
How you vary the keywords depends on your understanding of the heart of the question, in other words, how to get to the heart of the matter.
Isn't that what high school language class's emphasizes ability? Yes, it is.

<!-- 事实上, 你只需要具备一些基本的交际能力, 就能学会查阅资料, 和资料的内容没有关系,
来一本"民法大全", "XX手机使用说明书", "YY公司人员管理记录", 照样是这么查阅.
"查阅资料"是一种与领域无关的基本能力, 无论身处哪一个行业都需要具备,
如果你不想以后工作的时候被查阅资料的能力影响了自己的前途, 从现在开始就努力锻炼吧! -->
In fact, all you need is some basic social skills to learn how to access information, regardless of the content of the information, like "Civil Law Book", "XX Cell Phone Manual", "YY Company Management Records".
"Access to information" is a basic ability that is not related to the field, no matter what industry you are in, you need to have it, if you don't want to be stuck in the middle of a job in the future.
If you don't want your future to be jeopardized by your ability to access information, start practicing now!

> #### todo::mandatory question
> You will need to answer the following questions in your lab report.
> * <u>A program is a state machine</u> Draw the state machine of a program that computes `1+2+... +100` program, see [here](1.2.md#A computer is a state machine.).
> * <u>Understanding infrastructure</u> Let's walk through some simple calculations to see what the simple debugger can do.
>Start with the following assumptions.
> * Assume you need to compile NEMU 500 times to complete PA.
> * Assume that 90% of those 500 compilations are for debugging.
> * Assume that you have not implemented a simple debugger, and can only debug the client program running on NEMU through GDB.
> * In each debugging session, since GDB cannot observe the client program directly, it takes you 30 seconds to retrieve and analyze a message from GDB. 
> * Suppose you need to fetch and analyze 20 messages to troubleshoot a bug.
>
>   So how much time will you spend on debugging over the course of the semester?
>
>   Since the simple debugger can directly observe the client program, let's say it only takes 10 seconds to get and analyze the same information from the simple debugger.
> So how much debugging time will the simple debugger save you over the course of the semester?
>
>   In fact, these figures may still be a bit optimistic.
> Even if you use GDB to debug a client program directly, for example, these numbers assume that you can troubleshoot a bug in 10 minutes.
> If you actually need to obtain and analyze more information during the debugging process, the benefits of the simple debugger infrastructure are even greater.
> * <u>RTFM</u> Having understood the scientific approach to the manual.
> Please try to find out where the following questions are located in the ISA manual of your choice, and write down the scope of what you need to read in your lab report.
>   * x86
>     * What does the CF bit in the EFLAGS register mean?
>     * What is the ModR/M byte?
>     * What is the exact format of the mov instruction?
>   * mips32
>     * What are the instruction formats for mips32?
>     * What is CP0 register?
>     * What happens if the divisor of a division instruction is 0?
>   * riscv32
>     * What are the instruction formats for riscv32?
>     * What is the behavior of LUI instructions?
>     * What is the structure of the mstatus register?
> * <u>shell command</u> After completing the contents of PA1, what is the total number of lines of code in all the .c and .h and files in the `nemu/` directory?
> What command did you use to get this result? How many lines of code did you write in PA1 compared to the framework code?
> (Hint: the current `pa0` branch records exactly what it was before PA1, think about how to get back to the "past"?)
> You can write this command into a `Makefile`, and as you progress, you can easily count the number of lines of code in your project.
> For example, typing `make count` will automatically run a command that counts lines of code.
> On a more difficult subject, how many lines of code are in all the `.c` and `.h` files in the `nemu/` directory, excluding blank lines?
> * <u>RTFM</u> Open the `nemu/scripters/build.mk` file, and you'll see some of gcc's build options in the `CFLAGS` variable.
